# FloydW-project

This project is the steps to rewrite the Floyd Warshall Algorithm using Recursion (Python) from the imperative code

## How to begin

To understand the function of the algorithm, you can read the Floyd Warshall Algorithm wikipedia. 
EduLearn also explained in simple way how to start coding.

## Getting Started

I used the imperative code from (https://github.com/sheidaj/Re-write/blob/main/FloydAlgorithm%20-%20Imperative.pdf)
The first assumption in this project is 

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing

* I used replit.com
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
code blocks for commands
```

## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues.
```
command to run if program contains helper info
```
